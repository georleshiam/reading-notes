    <h1>Georleshia's World</h1>
    <p>
            Hey girl hey! It's me Gigi. I was born and raised in Memphis, TN. During my educational journey, I attended Memohis Business Academy High School were i graduated in 2019. Shortly after graduation I attended The Texas Southern University majoring in Biology. I was unable to complete school due to personal reasons and came back home to continue my path of life. While learning more about myself, I discovered my love for crafting and social media. I created my own furniture design business, started numerous social media platforms and learnned of my love for traveling. Four years after returning home, I gave birth to my beautiful daughter and decided i needed more. I discovered a program called CodeCrew were I found a new liking of coding. I am estatic to see what life has in store for me and the journey ahead being a blakc woman in tech.
         Here is a little bit more about me! Let's start with some of my favorites. I absolutley love to shop and create new things using my hands. Some of my best creations include a marble resin made bar. I'm an innovative and dedicated furniture designer that is professionally dedicated to satisfying my customers' design requirements. I enjoy the challenge of finding unique ways to fulfill my customers' needs. I believe that artistic expression can help people understand more about individuals around the world. My unique artistic talent has helped create over 50 unique pieces of artwork thoughout the Memphis area. This skill helps in my day to day life due to being able to problem solve and better evaluate situations. In the future I hope to 
    1.  Become a software developer

    3. Become a social media influencer
    4. Elevate my families quality of life
    5. Find my dream job
