Learn JS
Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.
<ol>
<li>What data types can you store inside of an Array?</li>
types that are part of javascript including objects and even other arrays
<li>Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?</li>
This is a valid javascript array it is a multi dimensional array and you would need to access the members like people[1][3] this would get the 4th item of the second array inside the outer most array.

<li>List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.</li>
+= adds the value on the right to the value stored in the variable on the left and assigns the new value to the variable
-= subtracts the value on the right from the value stored in the variable on the left and assigns the new value to the variable
/= divides the value in the variable on the left by the value on the right and stores the new value in the variable
*= multiplies the value in the variable on the left by the value on the right and stores the new value in the variable
%= stores the remainder from dividing the value stored in the variable on the left by the value on the right into the variable
<li>Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.</li>
This would evaluate to the string '10dog'. The a + c would be evaluated first because it is in the parentheses. Javascript would change false to 0 and add it to 10. then it would turn 10 to a string and concatenate it with 'dog' the value stored in b.
