#Domain Modeling

Explain why we need domain modeling.

**Domain modeling is a great tool for Agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics. The domain model is defined and continuously refactored as enterprise knowledge about the domain improves and the system functionality evolves.**

##HTML Table Basics

**HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout.**

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

**<section>: This defines a section in a web page. <article>: This element contains the main part, containing information about the web page. <aside>: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document. <footer>: It defines a footer for a document or a section.**

##Introducing Constructors

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

**Constructors are methods that are automatically executed every time you create an object. The purpose of a constructor is to construct an object and assign values to the object's members. A constructor takes the same name as the class to which it belongs, and does not return any values.**

How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

**When a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script for an object literal. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change wonâ€™t affect the object throughout the script.**

##Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

** Prototypes and inheritance are similar to adding branches to the main branch. My example will be creating a cake, the prototype will be the original recipe and the objects will be a different ingredient added.**
